    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic bread (also called garlic toast) consists of bread <em>(usually baguette, sourdough or ciabatta)</em> topped with garlic and occasionally olive oil or butter, and may include additional herbs, such as oregano or chives. It is then either grilled until toasted or baked in a conventional or bread oven.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>3 heads garlic</li>

<li><b><p>Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.</p></b></li>


<li><b><p>Set the oven to boil.</p>
</b></li> 

<li><b><p>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</p></b></li> 


<li><b><p>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread.</p></b></li> 


<li><b><p>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</p></b></li>
