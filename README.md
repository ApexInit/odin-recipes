# odin recipes

This is a simple HTML project where I'm making a simple recipe website. The web will have different types of recipes and useful links and resources will be provided for the reader. Different sets of headings, paragraphs and images will be used to make the content engaging for readers.

The web will also be designed with accessibility in mind for users who rely on screen readers.

Skills Demonstarted:
- Making a structured HTML web
- Adding images to websites
- Use of relative and absolute links
- Accessibility for screen readers
